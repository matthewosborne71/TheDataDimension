# The Data Dimension

This repository will contain files for a special lecture on dimension reduction techniques using python.
This is in conjunction with the Erd&#337;s Institute's 2019 coding bootcamp.

In this lecture we will go through some dimension reduction techniques. We will
start with PCA and give a few examples showing how useful it can be. Then we will
talk about t_SNE.
